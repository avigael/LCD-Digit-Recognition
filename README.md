# LCD-Digit-Recognition
Small Python program using computer vision to detect and store numbers from an LCD display in a CSV file.

I used this program to get the a specific set of numbers from the second line on the LCD display. The area used by the program can be adjusted on line 46 `if h > 75 and y > 180 and y < 280:`
